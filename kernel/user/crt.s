/* kernel/user/crt.s -- round K1: the four instructions a user
 * program cannot write in Firn.
 *
 * Everything else down here is Firn. What is left over is exactly what a
 * language has no words for:
 *
 *   1. THE ENTRY POINT. The kernel jumps to `_start` with `rdi` pointing
 *      at the argument block it built on the top stack page (see
 *      `kernel/elf.fi`), and with a stack pointer that is 16
 *      aligned. System V wants `rsp % 16 == 8` INSIDE a function -- the
 *      `call` below is what produces that, and a Firn function cannot
 *      emit a `call` to itself.
 *   2. THE WAY OUT. A Firn `fn` ends in `ret`, and there is nothing to
 *      return to: under `_start` lies no frame. The return value is the
 *      exit code, and `exit` is a system call.
 *   3. `osum_panic`. Under `profile kernel` a checked arithmetic site
 *      that goes out of range calls this name (SPEC section 13, item L9);
 *      the compiler leaves it undefined on purpose. In the kernel
 *      `isr.s` defines it. A program on the disk has no kernel to fall
 *      back on, so it defines its own: say what happened on descriptor 2
 *      and leave with 70. Without this definition every user program
 *      would carry an undefined symbol, and `ld` would refuse it.
 *
 * The system call numbers are the ones in `kernel/sys.fi`, and since
 * ROUND K4 those are Linux's: 60 = exit, 1 = write. Round K1 had 10 and 11
 * here, and the day the table changed underneath them this file was the
 * one that went quiet -- a program that printed everything it had and then
 * spun in the loop under `exit`, because `exit` had become a call the
 * kernel does not have and -ENOSYS does not stop anybody.
