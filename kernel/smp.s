/* kernel/smp.s -- round K5: the sixty lines a second processor
 * cannot be started without.
 *
 * This is the fourth non-Firn file of the kernel and it is here for the
 * same reason as the other three: what stands in it runs BEFORE the
 * machine is in a state a compiled function could run in. An application
 * processor does not wake up in long mode with paging and a stack. It
 * wakes up the way an 8086 woke up in 1978: REAL MODE, 16 bit, cs set to
 * the vector of the startup message and ip at zero, no page tables, no
 * descriptor table it may trust, and 1 MiB of address space. Everything
 * the boot processor got done for it by `boot.s` and the boot loader has
 * to happen again, on the core itself, in the first hundred instructions.
 *
 * WHY THE CODE IS COPIED. The `SIPI` message carries ONE octet of
 * address: the processor starts at `vector << 12`, so the entry point has
 * to lie in the first megabyte and on a page boundary. The kernel image
 * lies at 1 MiB. So the blob between `ap_trampoline` and
 * `ap_trampoline_end` is copied to `AP_BASE` at run time (`smp.fi`), and
 * every address in it is written as "base plus the distance from the
 * start of the blob" -- which is what the `.set ABS_*` lines below do.
 * The alternative, linking this section at 0x8000, would have put a
 * second load segment into the multiboot image for eleven lines of code.
 *
 * WHY THE PARAMETERS LIE IN MEMORY AND NOT IN REGISTERS. A processor
 * started by `SIPI` gets no arguments; the only thing it knows is where
 * it starts. So the boot processor writes what the core needs into a
 * block behind the code -- page table root, its stack, the entry in the
 * kernel, the data area, its number -- and waits until the core has set
 * `P_FLAG`. Only then is the block free for the next core. Bringing them
 * up one at a time costs a few milliseconds and saves the whole question
 * of what happens when two cores read the block at once.
 *
 * WHY THE DESCRIPTOR TABLE HERE HAS THE SAME LAYOUT AS THE ONE IN boot.s
 * (code64 at 0x08, data at 0x10). Not for tidiness: the core stays on
 * this table until Firn code loads the real one, and if the selector
 * numbers differed, the `lgdt` in `smp.ap_main` would leave cs pointing
 * at a different descriptor than the one the processor is executing
 * under. There is no way to reload cs from a compiled function -- that
 * needs a far jump. Keeping the layouts equal removes the need for one.
