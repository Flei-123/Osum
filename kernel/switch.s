/* kernel/switch.s -- round 62: the context switch.
 *
 * The third and last non-Firn file of the kernel, and it is here for the
 * same reason as the other two: what happens in it CANNOT be written in a
 * language. `context_switch` leaves one function and comes back in
 * another one -- it changes the stack pointer under the feet of the
 * running code. A compiler that is told nothing about this would keep
 * values in registers across the switch and read them back afterwards out
 * of the wrong task.
 *
 * Therefore the rule of this file: `context_switch` preserves EVERY
 * general purpose register and the flags. Only `rsp` changes. Whatever
 * the register allocator of firnc0 or the straight-line code of firnc1
 * believes about the machine stays true across the call -- with the one
 * exception of memory, and that is what `clobber("memory")` in
 * `sched.fi` is for.
 *
 *     context_switch(rdi = &old_task.rsp, rsi = new_task.rsp)
 *
 * The stack the switch leaves behind (from the new rsp upwards):
 *
 *     +0   rflags
 *     +8   r15   +16 r14  +24 r13  +32 r12  +40 r11  +48 r10
 *     +56  r9    +64 r8   +72 rdi  +80 rsi  +88 rbp  +96 rbx
 *     +104 rdx   +112 rcx +120 rax
 *     +128 the return address
 *
 * `sched.frame_build` writes exactly this layout for a task that has
 * never run: the return address is the first Firn function of the task,
 * and rdi/rsi/rdx are its arguments. A new task is therefore not a
 * special case in the switch -- it looks like a task that was switched
 * away from a moment ago.
