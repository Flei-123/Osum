"""tools/osum/break.py -- ELF files with exactly one thing wrong.

A loader is only worth as much as its refusals. This tool takes a program
that WORKS and changes ONE field, so that what the kernel says can be
traced back to that one field and to nothing else. The reason numbers are
`elf.R_*` in `kernel/elf.fi`.

    magic    the four octets 0x7F E L F        -> 4  R_MAGIC
    class    ELFCLASS64 -> ELFCLASS32          -> 5  R_CLASS
    endian   little -> big                     -> 6  R_ENDIAN
    version  e_ident version 1 -> 0            -> 7  R_VERSION
    type     ET_EXEC -> ET_DYN                 -> 8  R_TYPE
    machine  x86-64 -> i386                    -> 9  R_MACHINE
    phent    e_phentsize 56 -> 32              -> 10 R_SIZES
    phnum    e_phnum -> 99                     -> 11 R_PHNUM
    phoff    e_phoff -> 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00     -> 12 R_PHOFF
    short    the file cut to 32 octets         -> 3  R_SHORT
    noload   every PT_LOAD -> PT_NOTE          -> 21 R_NOLOAD
    segfile  segment 0 moved to the last page  -> 13 R_SEGFILE
    bigoff   p_offset -> 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF000    -> 13 R_SEGFILE
    memsz    p_filesz > p_memsz                -> 14 R_MEMSZ
    range    p_vaddr -> 0x50000000             -> 15 R_RANGE
    bigmem   p_memsz -> 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF0000     -> 15 R_RANGE
    align    p_vaddr + 8                       -> 16 R_ALIGN
    overlap  segment 1 onto segment 0          -> 17 R_OVERLAP
    noexec   the entry segment loses PF_X      -> 19 R_ENTRY

The last four of the numeric ones (`phoff`, `bigoff`, `bigmem`) are the
important ones: they are HUGE, and a loader that computes `off + filesz`
on them wraps around. Under `profile kernel` that is a CHECKED addition,
it calls `osum_panic`, and the kernel is dead instead of the file being
refused. Every bound in `elf.fi` is written as a subtraction because of
these three cases.
