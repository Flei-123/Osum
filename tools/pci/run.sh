# tools/pci/run.sh -- THE PROOF THAT THE KERNEL READS ITS MACHINE.
#
# Round 62 proved that the kernel is an operating system. Everything it
# spoke to, though, it knew by heart: 0x3F8 is the serial port, 0x60 the
# keyboard, 0x1F0 the disk, and the interrupt controller is the pair of
# 8259s from 1981. Those numbers are true because they have been true
# since 1986. They say nothing about the machine the kernel is on.
#
# This round replaces three of those certainties with questions, and every
# one of them is checked here WITH A COUNTER-CHECK -- a second run in
# which the thing is switched off and the measurement has to collapse.
# Without the second run the first one proves nothing: a list of devices
# that came out of a table in the kernel passes any test that only ever
# asks whether the expected line is there.
#
#   1. PCI. The device list is held against the `-device` arguments QEMU
#      was STARTED with, in both directions. Started without an NVMe
#      controller the line with class 01:08:02 must NOT be there; started
#      with one it must, with the BAR size the controller really has.
#      Three configurations, and the difference between them is the
#      measurement.
#   2. APIC. The local APIC's own timer replaces the PIT, the I/O APIC
#      replaces the two 8259s. Counter-check `noioapic`: the PIC is mute
#      and the keyboard line has no entry -- not one key may arrive. And
#      `noapic`: the old controller keeps the machine and everything works
#      as it did in round 62, which is what makes the switch a choice
#      rather than a rewrite.
#   3. NVMe over DMA. The controller fetches its own commands out of
#      memory and moves the data itself. Counter-check `nobm`: without
#      the bus master bit it may answer registers but may not fetch
#      anything -- the file system on it has to FAIL, and the image on the
#      host has to stay empty. Counter-check `noirq`: the message vector
#      is masked -- the transfer still happens and the interrupt does not,
#      and the two are told apart in the same run.
#   4. THE NUMBER. The same 128 KiB over the same interface, once through
#      the processor over ATA PIO and once past it over NVMe.
#
# Measured the way this project measures: QEMU per case, a time limit,
# serial output against expectations, exit code out of `isa-debug-exit`
# (21 = the kernel ended it, 63 = it stopped at an exception).
