# tools/userland/run.sh -- THE PROOF THAT OSUM HAS A USERLAND.
#
# Round K1 proved that a program comes off the disk: the kernel reads
# `/bin/sh`, lays it into an address space and starts it. What it did not
# prove -- because there was nothing to prove it with -- is that the
# programs on that disk are a SYSTEM. A shell that can only start a
# program is a program launcher; what makes it a shell is that it decides
# where the output of that program goes.
#
# So this file does not measure "it starts without crashing". It runs
# REAL COMMAND CHAINS in the shell that came off the disk and holds the
# whole transcript against a file written by hand, octet for octet:
#
#   1. THE TOOLS SAY THE RIGHT THING. sort, head, tail, wc, grep, uniq,
#      cat, echo, ls -- against an expected transcript, not against a
#      "did not crash".
#   2. REDIRECTION AND PIPES. `>` `>>` `<` `|`, three stages deep, and the
#      numbers that come out the far end have to be the right numbers.
#   3. THE SHELL IS A SHELL. A working directory that the CHILD sees,
#      variables, quoting, `$?` out of the process and not out of the
#      shell, `&` and `wait`, and a line editor with backspace and the
#      line before this one.
#   4. WHAT IS BROKEN IS SAID SO. A file that is not there, a directory
#      where a file was asked for, an empty input, a command that does not
#      exist, a directory that is not empty -- every one of them with its
#      message and its exit code.
#   5. THE DISK REALLY CHANGED. After the run the HOST reads the image
#      back: what `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv` and `rm` did is in the octets.
#   6. NOTHING LEAKS. Frames free before = frames free after, over runs
#      with more than a hundred processes in them.
#   7. THE OTHER COMPILER. firnc1 builds the same userland, and the same
#      script produces the same transcript.
#
# Usage:  bash tools/userland/run.sh
